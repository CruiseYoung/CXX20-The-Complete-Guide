The request for more non-type template parameters has existed since the first C++ standard. We have already discussed it in the first edition of C++ Templates â€“ The Complete Guide (see \url{http://tmplbook.com}).

Allowing arbitrary literal types for non-type template parameters was first proposed by Jens Maurer in \url{http://wg21.link/n3413}. Allowing class objects as non-type template parameters was then proposed for C++20 by Jeff Snyder in \url{http://wg21.link/p0732r0}. Allowing floating-point values as non-type template parameters was then proposed for C++20 by Jorg Brown in \url{http://wg21.link/p1714r0}.

The finally accepted wordings were formulated by Jeff Snyder and Louis Dionne in \url{http://wg21.link/p0732r2} and by Jens Maurer in \url{http://wg21.link/p1907r1}.
