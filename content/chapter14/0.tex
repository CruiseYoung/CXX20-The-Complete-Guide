C++20 introduces support for coroutines. Coroutines (invented in 1958 by Mel Conway) are functions you can suspend. This chapter explains the general concepts and most important details of coroutines.

C++20 starts with basic support for coroutines by introducing some core language features and some basic library features for dealing with them. However, significant glue code has to be written to be able to deal with coroutines, which makes using them very flexible but also requires some effort even in simple cases. The plan is to provide more standard types and functions for typical applications of coroutines in the C++ standard library with C++23 and later versions.

This chapter was written with tremendous help and support from Lewis Baker, Frank Birbacher, Michael Eiler, Bjorn Fahller, Dietmar K{\"o}uhl, Phil Nash, and Charles Tolman.
