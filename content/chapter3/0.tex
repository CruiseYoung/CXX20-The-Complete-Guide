This chapter introduces the new C++ feature concepts, with the keywords concept and requires. The feature is used to constrain the availability of generic code according to specified requirements.

For sure, concepts are a milestone for C++, because concepts provide a language feature for something we need a lot when writing generic code: specifying requirements. Although there have been workarounds, we now have an easy and readable way to specify the requirements for generic code, get better diagnostics when requirements are broken, disable generic code when it does not work (even though it might compile), and switch between different generic code for different types.
