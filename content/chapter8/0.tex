This chapter discusses the details of all view types that the C++20 standard library introduced.

The chapter starts with an initial overview of all view types and a discussion about general aspects of views, such as their common base class provided by the C++ standard library.

Afterwards, we discuss the various view types of C++20 in multiple sections grouped by general characteristics of the views: views that are the initial building blocks of view pipelines (using existing values or generating values themselves), filtering and transforming views, mutating views, and finally, views for multiple ranges. Each description of a view type starts with an overview of the most important characteristics.

Note that the next chapter about std::span discusses additional details of the span view (historically, spans were not part of the ranges library, but they are also views).
