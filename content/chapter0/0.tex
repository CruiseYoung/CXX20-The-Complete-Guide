This book presents all the new language and library features of C++20. It covers the motivation and context of each new feature with examples and background information.
As usual for my books, the focus lies on the application of the new features in practice and the book demonstrates how features impact day-to-day programming and how you can benefit from them in projects.

This applies to both application programmers and programmers who provide generic frameworks and foundation libraries.
