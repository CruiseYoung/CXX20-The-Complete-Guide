Do not be intimidated by the number of pages in this book. As always with C++, things can become pretty complicated when you look into details. For a basic understanding of the new features, the introductory motivations and examples are often sufficient.

In my experience, the best way to learn something new is to look at examples. Therefore, you will find a lot of examples throughout the book. Some are just a few lines of code that illustrate an abstract concept, whereas others are complete programs that provide a concrete application of the material. The latter kind of examples are introduced by a C++ comment that describes the file that contains the program code. You can find these files on the website for this book at http://www.cppstd20.com.
