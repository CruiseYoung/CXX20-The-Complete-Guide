The request to support coroutines was first proposed as a pure library extension by Oliver Kowalke and Nat Goodspeed in \url{http://wg21.link/n3708}.

Due to the complexity of the feature, a Coroutine TS (experimental technical specification) was established with \url{http://wg21.link/n4403} to work on details.

The wording to finally merge coroutines into the C++20 standard was formulated by Gor Nishanov in \url{http://wg21.link/p0912r5} .
