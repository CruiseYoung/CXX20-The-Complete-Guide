To get the most from this book, you should already be familiar with C++. You should be familiar with the concepts of classes and references in general, and you should be able to write C++ code using components of the C++ standard library, such as IOStreams and containers. You should also be familiar with the basic features of Modern C++, such as auto or the range-based for loop and other basic features introduced with C++11, C++14, and C++17.

However, you do not have to be an expert. My goal is to make the content understandable for the average C++ programmer who does not necessarily know all the details or all of the latest features. I discuss basic features and review more subtle issues as the need arises.

This ensures that the text is accessible to experts and intermediate programmers alike.
