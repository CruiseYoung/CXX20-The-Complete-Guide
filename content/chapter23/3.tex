Comparing integral values of different types is more complex than expected. This section describes two new features of C++20 for dealing with this problem:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Utilities for integral comparisons

\item 
std::ssize()
\end{itemize}

\mySubsubsection{23.3.1}{Safe Comparisons of Integral Values}

Comparing and converting numbers, even of different numeric types, should be a trivial task. Unfortunately, it is not. Almost all programmers have seen warnings about code doing this. These warnings have a good reason: because of implicit conversions, we may write unsafe code without noticing it.

For example, most of the time we expect that a simple x < y just works. Consider the following example:

\begin{cpp}
int x = -7;
unsigned y = 42;

if (x < y) ... // OOPS: false
\end{cpp}
