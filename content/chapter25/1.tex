Aggregates are simple class or struct types, with restrictions so that the focus lies on storing data and not providing complex behavior. Coming from the programming language C, they are historically raw arrays, structs, and combinations of these two features, which you can initialize with curly braces. In C++, the key requirement is that aggregates have only public data members, no constructors, and no virtual functions. Note that these requirements have changed slightly in C++20. Note also that you can now initialize aggregates with parentheses.

\mySamllsection{argument-dependent lookup (ADL)}

A feature that allows the programmer to skip namespace qualification of a function when one of the parameters is in its namespace. This means that a function is also looked up in all namespaces of the arguments passed.
