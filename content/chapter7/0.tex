After the introduction to ranges and views in the previous chapter, this chapter gives a first overview of important details and utilities (functions, types, and objects) that were introduced with C++20 to deal with ranges and views. In particular, this chapter covers:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The most important general purpose utilities for creating views

\item
A new way to categorize iterators and the consequence of this

\item
New iterator and sentinel types

\item
New functions and type functions for dealing with ranges and iterators
\end{itemize}

At the end, this chapter also lists all algorithms that C++20 now provides with details about whether the algorithms can be used for for ranges as a whole and a few key aspects that apply then.

Note that there are other places in this book where features of ranges are described in detail:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The general chapter about concepts presents all range concepts.

\item
The next chapter presents all the details of the standard view types.
\end{itemize}
