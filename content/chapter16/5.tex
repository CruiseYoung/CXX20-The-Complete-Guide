The idea of supporting modules in C++ is quite old. The first paper about this was published in 2004 by Daveed Vandevoorde in \url{http://wg21.link/n1736}.

Due to the complexity of the feature, a Modules TS (experimental technical specification) was established with \url{http://wg21.link/n4592} to work on details. Gabriel Dos Reis was the main driver for the content of this TS.

The wording to finally merge modules into the C++20 standard was formulated by Richard Smith in \url{http://wg21.link/p1103r3}. After that, a couple of fixes and clarifications were applied by various authors in various papers.
