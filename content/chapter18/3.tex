Every C++ version from C++11 until C++20 relaxed the constraints for constexpr functions. This now also means that the consteval functions have these constraints.

Basically, the constraints for constexpr and consteval functions are now as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Parameters and the return type (if there is one) must be literal types.

\item
The body may define only variables of literal types. These variables may neither be static nor thread\_local.

\item
Using goto and labels is not allowed.

\item
Constructors and destructors may be compile-time functions only if the class has no virtual base class.

\item
The functions cannot be used as coroutines.
\end{itemize}

The functions are implicitly inline.
