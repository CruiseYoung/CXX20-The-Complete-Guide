I welcome your constructive input—both negative and positive. I have worked very hard to bring you what I hope you will find to be an excellent book. However, at some point I had to stop writing, reviewing, and tweaking to “release the new revision.” You may therefore find errors, inconsistencies, presentations that could be improved, or topics that are missing altogether. Your feedback gives me a chance to fix these issues, inform all readers about the changes through the book’s website, and improve any subsequent revisions or editions.

The best way to reach me is by email. You will find the email address on the website for this book:

If you use the ebook, you might want to ensure you to have the latest version of this book available (remember it is written and published incrementally). You should also check the book’s website for the currently known errata before submitting reports. Please always refer to the publishing date of this version when giving feedback. The current publishing date is 2022-10-30 (you can also find it on page ii, the page directly after the cover).

Many thanks.
