C++11 introduced the chrono library with basic support for durations and timepoints. This allowed you to specify and deal with durations of different units and timepoints of different clocks. However, there was no support yet for high-level durations and timepoints such as dates (days, months, and years), weekdays, and for dealing with different timezones.

C++20 extends the existing chrono library with support for dates, timezones, and several other features. This extension is described in this chapter.
