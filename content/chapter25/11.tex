\mySamllsection{value category}

A classification of expressions. The traditional value categories lvalues and rvalues were inherited from the programming language C. C++11 introduced additional categories, meaning that C++ now has the following primary value categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item [-]
prvalues (pure rvalues), which are values used to initialize objects (including parameters)

\item [-]
lvalues (localizable values), which are objects you can ask for the address

\item [-]
xvalues (eXpiring values), which are objects where we no longer need the value (usually, objects marked with std::move())
\end{itemize}

In addition, C++ has the following combined value categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item [-]
glvalues (generalized lvalues), which means “either lvalue or xvalue”

\item [-]
rvalues (readable values), which means “either rvalue or xvalue”
\end{itemize}

\mySamllsection{variable template}

A generic variable. It allows us to define variables or static members by substituting the template parameters with specific types or values.


\mySamllsection{variadic template}

A template with a template parameter that represents an arbitrary number of types or values.
