C++ template parameters do not have to be only types. They can also be values (non-type template parameters (NTTP)). However, there are restrictions on the types these values can have. C++20 adds more types that can be used for non-type template parameters. Floating-point values, objects of data structures (such as std::pair<> and std::array<>) and simple classes, and even lambdas can now be passed as template arguments. This chapter describes these types and useful applications of this feature.

Note that there is another new feature for non-type template parameters: since C++20, you can use concepts to constrain the values of NTTPs.
