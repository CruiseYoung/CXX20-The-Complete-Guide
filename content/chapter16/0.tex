This chapter presents the new C++20 feature modules. Modules provide a way to combine code from multiple files into one logical entity (module, component). In the same way as for classes, data encapsulation helps to provide a clear definition of the API of the module. As a side effect, it is possible to ensure that module code does not have to be compiled multiple times, even if it is placed in “header files.”

This chapter was written with tremendous help and support from Daniela Engert and Hendrik Niemeyer, who also gave great introductions to this topic at the Meeting C++ conference 2020 and the ACCU 2021 conference, respectively.
