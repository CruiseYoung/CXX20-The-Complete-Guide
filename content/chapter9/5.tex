Spans were motivated as array\_views by Lukasz Mendakiewicz and Herb Sutter in \url{http://wg21.link/n3851} and first proposed by Neil MacIntosh in \url{http://wg21.link/p0122r0}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Neil MacIntosh and Stephan T. Lavavej in \url{http://wg21.link/p0122r7}.

Several modifications were added later on, such as removing all comparison operators as proposed by Tony Van Eerd in \url{http://wg21.link/P1085R2}, and removing const\_iterator support with the resolution of \url{http://wg21.link/lwg3320}.

After C++20 was released, the definition of views changed so that spans are now always views (see \url{http://wg21.link/p2325r3}).
