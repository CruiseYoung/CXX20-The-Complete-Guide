\mySamllsection{partial specialization}

An alternative definition for a (primary) template that still depends on one or more template parameters.

\mySamllsection{predicate}

A callable (function, function object, or lambda) that checks whether a certain criterion applies to one or more arguments. It returns a Boolean value, is read-only, and stateless.

\mySamllsection{prvalue}

A value category of expressions that perform initializations. Prvalues can be assumed to designate pure mathematical values such as 1 or true and temporary objects without names. Examples are:

\begin{itemize}
\item [-]
All literals except string literals (42, true, nullptr, etc.)

\item [-]
Returned values (values not returned by reference)

\item [-]
Returned lvalue references

\item [-]
Results of constructor calls

\item [-]
Lambdas

\item [-]
this
\end{itemize}

What was called an rvalue before C++11 is called a prvalue since C++11.
