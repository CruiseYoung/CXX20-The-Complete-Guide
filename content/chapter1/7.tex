The request for implicitly defined comparison operators was first proposed by Oleg Smolsky in \url{http://wg21.link/n3950}. The issue was then raised again by Bjarne Stroustrup in \url{http://wg21.link/n4175}. However, the final proposed wording, formulated by Jens Maurer in \url{http://wg21.link/p0221r2}, was ultimately rejected because it was an opt-out feature (thus, existing types would automatically have comparison operators unless they declared that they did not want this). Various proposals were then considered, which Herb Sutter brought together in \url{http://wg21.link/p0515r0}.

The finally accepted wording was formulated by Herb Sutter, Jens Maurer, and Walter E. Brown in \url{http://wg21.link/p0515r3} and \url{http://wg21.link/p0768r1}. However, significant modifications were accepted as formulated by Barry Revzin in \url{http://wg21.link/p1185r2}, \url{http://wg21.link/p1186r3}, \url{http://wg21.link/p1614r2}, and \url{http://wg21.link/p1630r1}.
