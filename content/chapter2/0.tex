Generic programming is a key paradigm of C++. Therefore, C++20 also provides several new features for generic programming. However, there is one basic extension that we will need more or less throughout this book: you can use now auto and other placeholder types to declare parameters of ordinary functions.

Later chapters will introduce more generic extensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Extensions for non-type template parameters

\item
Lambda templates
\end{itemize}
