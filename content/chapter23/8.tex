The string member functions starts\_with() and ends\_with() were accepted as proposed by Mikhail Maltsev in \url{http://wg21.link/p0457r2}.

The restriction of the reserve() function of strings was first proposed by Andrew Luo in \url{http://wg21.link/lwg2968}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Mark Zeren and Andrew Luo in \url{http://wg21.link/p0966r1}.

Access to the source location was first proposed by Robert Douglas in \url{http://wg21.link/n3972}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Robert Douglas, Corentin Jabot, Daniel Krugler, and Peter ¨ Sommerlad in \url{http://wg21.link/p1208r6}.

The functions for safe integral comparisons were accepted as proposed by Federico Kircheis in \url{http://wg21.link/p0586r2}.

The ssize() functions were discussed for a long time as a fix to the problem of comparing signed indexes with unsigned sizes. We would like to let all size() functions yield a signed value; however, there is the backward compatibility problem. As a reaction to a std::span proposal to use a signed size type, ssize() was first proposed by Robert Douglas, Nevin Liber, and Marshall Clow in \url{http://wg21.link/p1089r0}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Jorg Brown in \url{http://wg21.link/p1227r2}. std::ranges::ssize() was later added by Hannes Hauswedell, Jorg Brown, and Casey Carter in \url{http://wg21.link/p1970r2}.

The mathematical constants were first proposed by Lev Minkovsky in \url{http://wg21.link/p0631r0}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Lev Minkovsky and John McFarlane in \url{http://wg21.link/p0631r8}.

Bit operations were first proposed by Matthew Fioravante in \url{http://wg21.link/n3864}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Jens Maurer in \url{http://wg21.link/p0553r4} and \url{http://wg21.link/p0556r3}. The names were later modified as proposed by Vincent Reverdy in \url{http://wg21.link/p1956r1}.

std::bit\_cast<>() was introduced as finally proposed by JF Bastien in \url{http://wg21.link/p0476r2}.

std::endian was first proposed by Howard Hinnant in \url{http://wg21.link/p0463r0}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Howard Hinnant in \url{http://wg21.link/p0463r1}. The header file was later corrected as proposed by Walter E. Brown and Arthur O’Dwyer in \url{http://wg21.link/p1612r1}.

The header file <version> was accepted as proposed by Alan Talbot in \url{http://wg21.link/p0754r2}.

The new algorithms shift\_left() and shift\_right() were accepted as proposed by Dan Raviv in \url{http://wg21.link/p0769r2}. The new min/max algorithms for ranges were introduced with the ranges library as proposed in \url{http://wg21.link/p0896r4}.

The unseq execution policy was first proposed by Arch D. Robison, Pablo Halpern, Robert Geva, and Clark Nelson in \url{http://wg21.link/p0076r0}. The finally accepted wording was formulated by Alisdair Meredith and Pablo Halpern in \url{http://wg21.link/p1001r2}.
