Formatted output was first proposed by Victor Zverovich and Lee Howes in \url{http://wg21.link/p0645r0}.
The finally accepted wording was formulated by Victor Zverovich in \url{http://wg21.link/p0645r10}.

After C++20 was standardized, several fixes against C++20 were accepted. The most important was that format strings are checked and must be known at compile time, as formulated by Victor Zverovich in \url{http://wg21.link/p2216r3}. Others are \url{http://wg21.link/p2372r3} (fixing locale handling of chrono formatters) and \url{http://wg21.link/p2418r2} (format arguments become universal/forwarding references).
