C++ has different versions defined by different C++ standards.

The original C++ standard was published in 1998 and was subsequently amended by a technical corrigendum in 2003, which provided minor corrections and clarifications to the original standard. This “old C++ standard” is known as C++98 or C++03.

The world of “Modern C++” began with C++11 and was extended with C++14 and C++17. The international C++ standards committee now aims to issue a new standard every three years. Clearly, that leaves less time for massive additions, but it brings the changes to the broader programming community more quickly. The development of larger features, therefore, takes time and might cover multiple standards.

C++20 is now the beginning of the next “Even more Modern C++” evolution. Again, several ways of programming will probably change. However, as usual, compilers need some time to provide the latest language features. At the time of writing this book, C++20 is already at least partially supported by major compilers. However, as usual, compilers differ greatly in their support of new different language features. Some will compile most or even all of the code in this book, while others may only be able to handle a significant subset. I expect that this problem will soon be resolved as programmers everywhere demand standard support from their vendors.
