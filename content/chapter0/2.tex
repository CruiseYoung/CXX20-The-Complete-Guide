This book covers all changes to C++ introduced with C++20. This applies to both language and library features as well as both features that affect day-to-day application programming and features for the sophisticated implementation of (foundation) libraries. However, the more general cases and examples usually come first.

The different chapters are grouped, but the grouping has no deeper didactic reasoning other than that it makes sense to first introduce features that might be used by the subsequent features introduced afterwards. In principle, you can read the chapters in any order. If features from different chapters are combined, there are corresponding cross-references.
